**A/B Testing Template for Product Managers**

---

### 1. **Test Overview**
   - **Test Name:**
   - **Objective:**
     - Clearly define the purpose of the A/B test (e.g., improve conversion rate, enhance user engagement).
   - **Hypothesis:**
     - State the hypothesis being tested (e.g., "Changing the CTA button color from blue to green will increase clicks by 10%").
   - **Metrics:**
     - Primary metric(s): (e.g., click-through rate, sign-ups, revenue per user)
     - Secondary metric(s): (e.g., bounce rate, session duration)

### 2. **Audience**
   - **Target Segment:**
     - Define the audience to be included (e.g., new users, mobile app users, geographic region).
   - **Exclusions:**
     - Outline users or groups to be excluded (e.g., internal testers, inactive users).

### 3. **Variants**
   - **Control (A):**
     - Description of the current experience.
   - **Variant (B):**
     - Description of the new experience being tested.
   - Additional Variants (if applicable):
     - Describe other variations (e.g., Variant C, D).

### 4. **Test Design**
   - **Sample Size:**
     - Estimated number of users needed for statistical significance.
     - Link to a sample size calculator or include assumptions.
   - **Split Ratio:**
     - Percentage of users assigned to each variant (e.g., 50/50 or 80/20).
   - **Duration:**
     - Expected test run time (e.g., 2 weeks).
   - **Randomization:**
     - Methodology for ensuring unbiased assignment of users to variants.
   - **Power Analysis:**
     - Definition: A power analysis determines the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a certain level of confidence.
     - Inputs: Include details on significance level (e.g., 0.05), statistical power (e.g., 80%), and effect size (e.g., minimum detectable change in the primary metric).
     - Calculation Tools: Provide links to tools or scripts used for power analysis (e.g., R, Python scripts, or online calculators).
     - Example: "To detect a 5% increase in click-through rate with 80% power and a 0.05 significance level, we require a sample size of 10,000 users per group."
   - **A/A Testing Plan:**
     - **Purpose:** To validate the A/B testing framework by ensuring no significant differences exist between identical variants.
     - **Metrics:** Same primary and secondary metrics as planned for A/B tests.
     - **Duration:** Recommended to run for the same duration as typical A/B tests to detect random variances.
     - **Implementation:**
       - Use the same audience segmentation and randomization methods as in the A/B test.
       - Assign all users equally to two identical variants (e.g., A and A').
     - **Analysis:**
       - Evaluate if any statistically significant differences arise between the identical groups.
       - Investigate and address any anomalies before proceeding with A/B testing.

### 5. **Implementation Plan**
   - **Steps for Launch:**
     1. Development tasks (e.g., creating the variant UI).
     2. QA testing.
     3. Deployment schedule.
   - **Tools/Platforms:**
     - List tools or platforms used (e.g., Optimizely, Google Optimize).

### 6. **Success Criteria**
   - **Definition of Success:**
     - Outline what constitutes a "successful" result.
   - **Thresholds:**
     - Define the minimum detectable effect size (e.g., 5% lift in the primary metric).

### 7. **Risk Assessment**
   - **Potential Risks:**
     - Identify risks (e.g., user churn, data privacy issues).
   - **Mitigation Strategies:**
     - Outline strategies to address risks.

### 8. **Analysis Plan**
   - **Statistical Methodology:**
     - Method for analyzing results (e.g., t-test, chi-square test).
   - **Segmentation Analysis:**
     - **Purpose:** To uncover performance variations across user subgroups.
     - **Examples of Segmentation:**
       - By device type (e.g., mobile, desktop, tablet).
       - By geographic region (e.g., North America, EMEA).
       - By user behavior (e.g., new vs. returning users).
       - By demographics (e.g., age group, gender).
     - **Implementation:**
       - Define key segments before the test begins.
       - Ensure proper tagging and tracking to differentiate segments.
     - **Analysis Steps:**
       - Compare results within each segment to identify trends or anomalies.
       - Check for interactions between segment attributes and test variants.
     - **Reporting:**
       - Provide detailed breakdowns for each segment in the results.
       - Highlight actionable insights or areas needing further exploration.
   - **Considerations for Noise:**
     - Address external factors that might affect test results (e.g., seasonality, promotions).

### 9. **Results**
   - **Summary:**
     - Brief overview of findings.
   - **Key Metrics:**
     - Include tables or charts with metric comparisons (e.g., Control vs. Variant).
   - **Insights:**
     - Detail learnings from the test.

### 10. **Recommendations**
   - **Next Steps:**
     - Actions based on results (e.g., roll out the winning variant, iterate on the design).
   - **Long-term Implications:**
     - Implications for future tests or product development.
